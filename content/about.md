# About

I break and fix cloud infrastructure for a living, mostly in environments where one wrong IAM policy could end up in a congressional hearing.

AWS is home. Mostly, the US GovCloud side of it, where everything takes twice as long, costs more, and half the services you actually want don't exist yet. I spend my days writing SCPs that prevent entire teams from doing bad things and explaining to people why "just give it admin access" is not an architecture decision.

I also plan to blog about this stuff here.

Vibe coding is real and I'm not apologizing for it. Half my best Terraform modules started as a loose prompt and a "let's see where this goes" attitude. The other half started the same way but I'll never admit it.

If you're into cloud infrastructure, GovCloud pain, or arguing about best Terraform repo structure, you're in the right place.
