# About

I break and fix cloud infrastructure for a living.

AWS is home. Mostly, the US GovCloud side of it, where everything takes twice as long, costs more, and half the services you actually want don't exist yet. I spend my days writing SCPs that prevent entire teams from doing bad things and explaining to people why "just give it admin access" is not an architecture decision.

I also plan to blog about this stuff here.

If you're into cloud infrastructure, GovCloud pain, or arguing about best Terraform repo structure, you're in the right place. :)
