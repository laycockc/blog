Welcome. I'm Chris, an AWS nerd who spends most days deep in Terraform and infrastructure design.

This blog is where I share what works, what breaks, and what I learn while building federal-compliant cloud workloads. Expect practical posts on:

- Terraform patterns for real-world teams
- AWS architecture for regulated environments
- Security and operational controls that hold up under scrutiny

If you're building in GovCloud, chasing FedRAMP requirements, or just trying to keep infrastructure sane at scale, you're in the right place.
